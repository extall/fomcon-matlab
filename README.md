# fomcon-matlab
FOMCON toolbox for MATLAB R2010a+

# Installation Instructions

## Prerequisites
The following MATLAB toolboxes are required for FOMCON to work:
* Control System toolbox;
* Optimization toolbox.
However, even if the Optimization toolbox is not available in the MATLAB installation, it is still possible to use certain toolbox features.

## Installation
The installation currently comprises the following steps:
* Decompress the zipped folder into a directory of your choice, e.g. *C:\fomcon\*
* Setup the directory in your MATLAB path. In the MATLAB, go to *File > Set Path...* and click on *Add with Subfolders...*. Now, select the directory that contains the *fomcon* folder.
* Save the path for future MATLAB sessions (usually administrator priveleges are necessary). This completes the installation.
